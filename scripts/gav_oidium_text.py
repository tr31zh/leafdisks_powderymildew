OIV 452-2 is a standard to evaluate resistance to powdery mildew in vine disk leafs

> &mdash; From OIV the 452-2 specification.
>
>  Characteristic: Leaf: degree of resistance to Plasmopara (leaf disc test)  
>  Notes:
>  1: very little 3:little 5:medium 7:high 9:very high   
>  Observation during the whole vegetation period, as long as there are young leaves, on vines not treated with
>  chemicals.
>  Because the zoospores penetrate through the stomata, the leaf discs have to be placed with the lower surface up.
>  Using a standardized spore suspension with 25000 spores/ml (counting chamber), a pipette is used to place 40Âµl
>  or 1000 spores on each leaf disc.
>  Incubation: in complete darkness (aluminum coat), room temperature, 4 days.
>  Remark: if the inoculum remains on the leaf disc too long, lesions are produced. Therefore, 24 hours after
>  inoculation, the spore suspension has to be removed by blotting with a filter paper.
